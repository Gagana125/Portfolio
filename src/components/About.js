            <p>
              I am Gagana Samarasekara, a final-year Computer Science undergraduate at the University of Colombo School of Computing. 
              I am passionate about technology, with a strong interest in both Augmented Reality (AR) and web development. 
              I enjoy exploring innovative ways to create impactful applications that blend creativity with functionality. 
              Over the years, Iâ€™ve successfully balanced academics with extracurricular activities, which has shaped me into a well-rounded individual.  
            </p>
            <p>     
              During my school and university years, I actively participated in sports, with table tennis being my main focus, and won several tournaments. 
              I was also involved in clubs like AIESEC and Rotaract, where I gained valuable experience in teamwork and leadership. 
              These experiences have taught me how to collaborate effectively and take on leadership roles when needed. 
              I bring this same dedication and enthusiasm to all my projects and look forward to contributing to exciting challenges in both AR and web development.
